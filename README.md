## Descripton
File Loader - is a library for the android platform. It allows you to download any files without much effort and get the result in the thread you specified.

## Capabilities
- Download any files by their link
- Save files in the specified folder
- Get the result as bytes
- Add files to the queue for their further download
- Track all stages of downloading files

## How to use ?

```java
Loader.with(Context)
        .fromUrl("YOUR_URL")
        .load();
```

## Description of methods
**Required**
```
- with(Cntext) - the main method with the context
- addInQueue("YOUR_URL") - add the file to the download queue
- load() - start downloading files
```

**Optional**
```
- to("YOUR_PATH") - the path to which the file will be uploaded
- addInQueue("YOUR_URL") - add file to the download queue
- skipIfFileExist() - the download will be terminated if the file already exists (by default, the file is overwritten)
- abortNextIfError() - interrupt the remaining downloads waiting in the queue, if an error occurred during the download
- makeImmortal() - the files will be downloaded in the foreground. Download does not stop even if it is unloaded from memory
- notification(Notification) - connect your notification, which will be displayed at the time of downloading files
- redownloadAttemptCount(4) - the number of attempts to download the file, in case there was an error
- skipCache() - do not save the file in the device memory
- viewNotificationOnFinish() - do not close the notification after downloading files
- hideDefaultNotification() - hide notification when loading files (not recommended)
- downloadReceiver() - setting DownloadReceiver will allow you to set events to get feedback from the loader
- onStart(OnStart) - the event notifies the start of the download of the next file
- onError(OnError) - the event notifies you when an error occurred while loading the file
- onCompleted(OnCompleted) - the event notifies when the next file is being downloaded
- onProgress(OnProgress) - event to track the progress of the download
- receivedFile(ReceivedFile) - after the download is complete, get the path to the downloaded file
- receivedFileSource(ReceivedFileSource) - after the download is complete, get the source file as a byte array
- enableLogging() - enable logging while downloading files
```

**Additional Methods**
```
loader.cancel() - abort all downloads and delete the underloaded file
loader.unsubscribe - unsubscribe from events (download will not be interrupted)
```

**Note**
```
- if you do not specify to ("YOUR_PATH"), then by default the files will be saved in the application cache - Context.getCacheDir()
- notification(Notification), hideDefaultNotification(), viewNotificationOnFinish() - work only when you set makeImmortal()
- to set the events (onStart, onError, etc.), you must set DownloadReceiver
- if you set the receivedFileSource event, the data will go into this method WITHOUT CONSERVATION on the device
```
